# Train dataset - Insulator-Defect Detection

</div>

# Overview

There are few insulator-defect datasets published for overhead transmission lines, or even in the whole electric power field. In total, 1600 original images were captured from Baidu and Google or collated from public datasets. The resolution width of the image pixels in this dataset is more than 2000–5000 and the height value is more than 2000–3000. Insulators and the insulator dataset are constructed according to the original pictures, which mainly include two defects: pollution flashover and damage.

>Two different types of defects: (a) pollution flashover; (b) damage.
